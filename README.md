# Analyze_Sort
** Purpose of This project** 
---
I used Java for this project. This project is to see what is the most efficient sorting algorithm.
the program counts the number of swaps and comparisons that was made in each sorting algorithms. 
The array for sorting, there is inorder, reverse, random and almost order.
When the program runs, it displays each sorting algorithms swaps and comparison and 
the time it took to sort the array for each type of array.
